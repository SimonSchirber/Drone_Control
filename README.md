# Drone_Control
For general xbox joystick and button controller reading, I created the The xbox_controller_general.py script which uses pygame to read the console input. Make sure that the controller is bluetooth paired to the computer. I found the joysticks to be somewhat finnicky so you may want to mess with the thresholds for different movements to trigger and take off the FIR filter I added.

I used the record_and_move.py script to shoot a recording while flying and have facial recognition.

A video example of the controller in action can be found at https://youtu.be/YPtIvC1LSLE
